#Using the responsive.inc

Editorial staff can use the inc without needing any work from developers

The inc can be used by adding the correct parameters into the URL.

    /news/special/2014/newsspec_7655/touchcast-responsive.inc?tcid={TOUCH_CAST_ID}&imageurl={IMAGE_URL}
    

Where the following are replaced accordingly:

+ **{TOUCH_CAST_ID}** - The touchcast ID
+ **{IMAGE_URL}** - The images full URL (including http://)

An example .inc (this uses the birmingham touchcast)
